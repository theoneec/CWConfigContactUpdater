# 🔧 ConnectWise Configuration Contact Updater

This script connects to the ConnectWise Manage REST API and performs a series of data processing and update tasks to review and correct contact assignments on device configurations.

---

## 📋 What It Does

The script performs the following steps:

### **Step 1 – Retrieve Configurations**
- Pulls all configurations for a specified company using the provided `CompanyId`.
- Saves the full JSON response for each configuration.
- Exports a flattened snapshot to `step1_config_snapshot.csv`.

### **Step 2 – Extract Contact Info from Configurations**
- Loads the JSONs retrieved in Step 1.
- Extracts the `contact.id`, `contact.name`, and `contact._info` values.
- Exports a new enriched CSV (`step2_config_with_contacts.csv`).

### **Step 3 – Clean Configuration CSV**
- Cleans up the data for easier processing.
- Extracts only required fields:
  - `id`, `name`, `lastLoginName`, `activeFlag`, `contact.name`, `contact.id`, `contact._info`
- Output saved to: `step3_cleaned_configs.csv`.

### **Step 4 – Refresh Company Contacts**
- Queries the ConnectWise API to get **all** company contacts (with paging support).
- Saves to: `step4a_company_contacts.csv`.

### **Step 4B – Match Contacts Based on Last Login
- Extracts the username from the lastLoginName field (e.g., from DOMAIN\JaneSmith → JaneSmith).
- Uses casing patterns to split the username into first and last names (JaneSmith → Jane Smith).
- Constructs a guessed full name based on this logic.
- Compares the guessed name with the contact names retrieved in Step 4A.
- Flags each configuration with:
	- matched – whether the guessed name matches the currently assigned contact.
	- exists – whether the guessed name exists in the known contact list.
- Saves results to: `step4b_contact_guess.csv`.

### **Step 5 – Update Configurations (Where Needed)**
- For unmatched configurations that have a valid contact match:
  - Updates the configuration’s assigned contact.
  - PUT request to the ConnectWise API.
  - Uses JSON files generated from Step 2 as base.

### **Step 6 – Cleanup**
- Deletes all temporary `.json` and `.csv` files generated by previous steps.

```

### 🧩 Parameters

|----------------------|----------|-------------|
| `CWCompanyId`        | ✅       | Your CW Manage company ID |
| `PublicKey`          | ✅       | Your API public key |
| `PrivateKey`         | ✅       | Your API private key |

| `CompanyId`          | ✅       | The short code (identifier) of the company (e.g., `ZWF`) |
| `Site`               | ✅       | Base URL of your CW instance (e.g., `https://api-au.myconnectwise.net`) |
| `ApiVersion`         | ❌       | Optional. Defaults to `2025.1`. You can just pass the version number (e.g., `2024.4`) |
| `BypassBaseUrlCheck` | ❌       | Use this switch if you're working with a self-hosted ConnectWise environment |

## 🛠 Notes

- If the provided `Site` URL does not match known ConnectWise regions (`NA`, `AU`, `EU`), the script will show a warning unless you pass `-BypassBaseUrlCheck`.
- All major steps export intermediate CSVs for visibility and debugging.
- You can safely rerun the script to regenerate outputs or pick up changes.
